The speed of removal must be a compromise between a  rapid movement and a slower rate that is more comfortable for the patient. Usually an alginate impression does not adhere to the oral tissues as well as some of the elastomers do, so it is easier to remove the alginate impression rapidly. However, it is always best to avoid torquing or twisting the impression in an effort to remove it quickly. Specifically, the handle should be used minimally during breaking of the air seal (“suction”) or removal of the tray from the teeth.\nPhillips dental materials 12th edition page no 174", "subject_name": "Dental", "topic_name": null}

Two-thirds of the first mandibular molars found in a Chinese population had this variation. Similarly, this distolingual root occurred in 4% of mandibular first molars of a Kuwaiti population. These results confirm the observation that East Asian populations have more three-rooted mandibular first molars than do other racial groups. Mandibular molars, mainly first molars, may also have an additional root located lingually or buccally. Although this is a rare occurrence in Caucasian populations, it is more common in Asian populations. The radix entomolaris (RE) is a supernumerary root located distolingually in mandibular molars, whereas the radix paramolaris (RP) is an extra root located mesiobuccally. Each root usually contains a single root canal. The orifice of the RE is located distolingually to mesiolingually from the main canal or canals of the distal root; the orifice of the RP is located mesiobuccally to distobuccally from the main mesial root canals. \nKey Concept:\nThe figure in the question show radix entomolaris.", "subject_name": "Dental", "topic_name": null}

Secondary bone grafting is done during the mixed dentition stage after the eruption of permanent incisors, but before the eruption of permanent canines. The timing of bone graft is based on the root formation and eruption pattern of the maxillary lateral incisor and maxillary canine. In case, insufficient bone is available in the cleft area for the lateral incisors to erupt, bone graft can be done around 7 years of age.\nNote: In this patient, since the transverse width is normal, there is no need for expansion.\nOrthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities 3rd ed Om P.

It is believed that carbon can embrittle the alloys, even though the investment is heated to temperatures that burn out the carbon. Some evidence indicates that palladium reacts with carbon at temperatures above 1504 °C. Thus, if the casting temperature of an alloy with high palladium content exceeds this critical point, a phosphate investment without carbon should be used.\nRef: Phillip’s 12th edition page 208", "subject_name": "Dental", "topic_name": null}

Its surface may have a smooth, lobulated, or, occasionally, warty appearance that is erythematous and often ulcerated. Depending on the age of the lesion, the texture varies from soft to firm and is suggestive of an ulcerated fibroma. \nBecause of the pronounced vascularity of these lesions, they often bleed easily when probed.\nHistologically, the pyogenic granuloma presents as a remarkable proliferation of plump fibroblasts and endothelial cells with the formation of prominent numbers of  thin-walled, endothelium-lined vascular channels. A polymorphous inflammatory cell infiltrate is present, and the overlying surface epithelium is often ulcerated. Treatment consists of surgical excision, with care being taken to completely remove any local irritant that may still be present that would predispose to recurrence of the lesion.\nReference: McDONALD AND AVERY’S DENTISTRY for the CHILD and ADOLESCENT, 10th ed page no 604,605", "subject_name": "Dental", "topic_name": null}

Methyl mercury is a major safety concern because it bioaccumulates through the food chain; its pharmacokinetic half-life is longer (1.5 to 3 months) than that of ethyl mercury (less than 1 week). In air, the concentrations of mercury range from about 0.01 to 0.02 µg/m3.\nMercury accumulates in the kidneys. In the brain, metallic mercury can be converted to an inorganic form that is retained in the brain. Elemental mercury and mercury vapor have a half-life of 1 to 3 months. Mercury leaves the body by excretion through urine and feces.\nExposure to high levels of mercury can injure the brain, kidneys, and developing fetus. Chronic mercury toxicity may be manifested as tremors; memory loss; and changes in personality, vision, and hearing.\nReference: PHILLIPS’ SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 124", "subject_name": "Dental", "topic_name": null}

M. Ricketts suggested using an esthetic (E) plane to evaluate the relationship between the nose, lips and chin. Ricketts’ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. A quick method to look at one profile is to imagine a line tangent from the lower chin to the nose tip. Cephalometrically, Ricketts’ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. Normal values suggest that the upper lip is 4 mm behind the E line, while the lower lip lies 2 mm behind this reference line. It is important to mention that, this reference line is influenced a great deal by the growth of the nose and also varies with age and sex. Ricketts recommended that lip position should be analyzed using the nose–chin line as a reference point.

This is surprising when considering that severe leakage takes place at its margins. \nAlso, the incidence of contact caries is less when compared to amalgam restorations (contact caries is the term applied to caries occurring on the proximal surface of the tooth adjacent to the restoration). \nThe anti-cariogenic property is due to presence of 15% fluoride. Fluoride release is slow and occurs throughout the life of the restoration. Silicate cement was classed as a severe irritant to the pulp because of its low pH (acidic). \nFor many years, silicate served as a standard for comparing the pulpal response to other materials. In deep cavities, the pulp had to be protected with varnish or calcium hydroxide.\n\nManapallil 3rd Ed P: 88", "subject_name": "Dental", "topic_name": null}

The imperative here is to come up with an acceptable compromise for the dentition, one that will mask the underlying skeletal deformity as much as possible. This can be achieved using Steiner’s sticks, which allow calculations to be carried out for a particular ANB value.\nIn addition to commonly used sagittal discrepancy indicators, that is angle ANB, sagittal maxilla mandibular relationship should be reconfirmed with other variables which include WITS appraisal, A–B plane angle and beta angle. \nKey Concept:\nTweed’s analysis (originally undertaken in 1954) is primarily based on inclination of the mandibular incisors to the basal bone and the latter’s association with the vertical relation of the mandible to the cranium. Tweed’s analysis is clinically oriented. It does not directly assess the jaws.\n \nReference: Orthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities 3rd O P Kharbanda, pdf no 1016,997,981,2463", "subject_name": "Dental", "topic_name": null}

The amount of maxillary movement is influenced by a number of factors like:\n\nAmount of force: Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition.\nDirection of force: According to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.\n\tIn most cases of maxillary deficiency, maxilla is deficient in the vertical plane as well, therefore, a slight downward, direction of force is usually desirable. The line of force passes below the center of resistance of the maxilla producing a counter-clockwise moment on the maxilla and dentition. This results in a possible extrusion of maxillary posterior teeth leading to a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.\n\tHowever, in patients with increased anterior facial height, downward pull is contradicted.\nDuration of force: A review of literature shows duration to vary between 3 and 16 months. On an average at least 8-12 months of wear is required to produce the desired effect.\nFrequency of use: 12-14 hrs/day.\n\nKey Concept:\nAccording to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.\nReference: Textbook of orthodontics 2nd ed Gurkeerat Singh page no 502", "subject_name": "Dental", "topic_name": null}
